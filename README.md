### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**deepbag/deepbag** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently doing Engineering.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React/Flutter/PHP.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to Part time job as a freelancer.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about learning React/Flutter/PHP/HTML/Bootstrap.
- âš¡ Fun fact: The usual programmers drink coffee while coding but I coding while listening to the song.
